# Swift - *FlixApp*

## Description

**FlixApp** was one of iOS applications I had developed while I was taking CodePath training program at Queens College.

The app was a practice of integrating RESTful API into Swift UI.
- Utilized The Movie DB API to fetch movie data.  
- set the movie data as previews on cell UI.  
- displayed movie details after one of the previews was selected.
