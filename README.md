# *FlixApp*

## Description

**FlixApp** was one of iOS applications I had developed while I was taking CodePath program at Queens College.

The app is a practice of Swift by connecting to a movie API and listing the content of movies. The app is designed base on Flix app, which displays a movie list by applying cell UI. The cell of the list will display tableView and post view. When a movie is selected, it will go to its detail view, which contains the post and the description.
